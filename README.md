# Homecredit Capstone Project

This is a group project that I completed for my capstone with 3 other colleagues.

## Business Problem

Homecredit is a company that gives loans to the underserved population. In other words, these are clients who do not have conventional or nonexistent credit histories. Homecredit however, like any conventional financial institution faces financial loss if loans are given to clients who cannot pay it back. The median financial loss for approving a client who cannot pay back a loan is **$24,412 dollars**. Furthermore, Homecredit must also deal with the issue of forgone revenue if it rejects clients who could pay back the loan. The median potential revenue loss for incorrectly rejecting a client is **$23,800 dollars**. Both of these outcomes are bad and severely impact Homecredit's ability to operate.

### Project Objective

The objective of this project is to minimize both of these losses which will enable HomeCredit to operate more efficiently. It will also ensure that Homecredit can more accurately approve/reject applications.

## Problem Solution

Our group approached this problem by first conducting Exploratory Data Analysis individually. Afterwards, we reivewed our results and created a final clean dataset to use for training models. The next step was to experiment with various models such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, XGboost, etc. After we were done experimenting with the models, we selected the best model that would help improve Homecredit's ability to accept/reject applications.

The final model we selected was XGboost which had an
